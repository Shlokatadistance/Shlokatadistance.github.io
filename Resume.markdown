Latest updated Resume! 


<p> You can simply find it here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HHxa-cjTyfEJJ8Eu8MT0XvwKaeCWz3sL/view?usp=sharing">Shlok Sinha </a> </p>

<p> I am stil trying to figure out a way to share the resume right here, the issue is with the restrictions posed by markdown files and the deprication of certain embedding methods in web browsers, especially with Safari </p>
