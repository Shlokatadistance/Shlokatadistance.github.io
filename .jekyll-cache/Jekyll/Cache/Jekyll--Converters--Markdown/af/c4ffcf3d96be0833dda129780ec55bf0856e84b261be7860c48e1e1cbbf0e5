I",<p>Coding is all about growing. I have tried my hands in almost all aspects of the subject and played with some interesting
exercises.</p>

<p><b>1.Deep Learning Based Detector</b></p>

<p>While Python has packages to achieve the job, the end result is what can be characterised as ‘unusual’. Deep Learning offers a far nuanced and reliable solution.
I utilised the Caffe framework and came up with the document scanner, which learns and recognises object patterns and most importantly edges, which is the main objective here.</p>

<p><b>Technology used - Python, Caffe</b></p>

<p><b>2.Tech ++</b></p>

<p>Like many student based sites, Tech++ is aimed at connecting students from across the world. Students can use the site either to share valuable material and resources, or share their experiences for the benifit of their peers and others seeking the same opportunities.</p>

<p><b>Technology used - MERN Stack</b></p>

<p><b>3.New Hope Organisation Client Onboarding Platform</b></p>

<p>As a challenge in JP Morgan Chase Code for Good 2020, we (team) came up with a solution to make it easier for social organisations to add in new applicants into their list, through the aid of a mobile application.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This not only saves man hours in terms of the time invested in adding a new person, but its also a seamless process because it eliminates the dependency on unorganised forms of communication and administration such as emails and texts.</li>
  <li>With the app, the social worker can simply take in the application, fill it, add the required document and start working.</li>
  <li>We also built an online database management system, functioning as an admin console such that the social organisation overall can have control monitoring over their applicants’ status.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Technology used - React, React-Native, Springboot, MaterialUI</b></p>

<p><b>4.Employee-Management System</b></p>

<p>A basic and functional employee directory and adminstration program, which helps one to view and edit employee details.</p>

<p><b>Technology used - C++</b></p>
