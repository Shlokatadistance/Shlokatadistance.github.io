Coding is all about growing. I have tried my hands in almost all aspects of the subject and played with some interesting
exercises.

<b>1.Deep Learning Based Detector</b>

While Python has packages to achieve the job, the end result is what can be characterised as 'unusual'. Deep Learning offers a far nuanced and reliable solution.
I utilised the Caffe framework and came up with the document scanner, which learns and recognises object patterns and most importantly edges, which is the main objective here.

<b>Technology used - Python, Caffe</b>

<b>2. LSTM Based Stock Price Prediction Model </b>

The project utilises LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) networks to work on historical data and predict future stock prices. The project achieved a 47.2% accuracy on the backtest.

<b>3.New Hope Organisation Client Onboarding Platform</b>

As a challenge in JP Morgan Chase Code for Good 2020, we (team) came up with a solution to make it easier for social organisations to add in new applicants into their list, through the aid of a mobile application.  
- This not only saves man hours in terms of the time invested in adding a new person, but its also a seamless process because it eliminates the dependency on unorganised forms of communication and administration such as emails and texts.
- With the app, the social worker can simply take in the application, fill it, add the required document and start working.
- We also built an online database management system, functioning as an admin console such that the social organisation overall can have control monitoring over their applicants' status.

<b>Technology used - React, React-Native, Springboot, MaterialUI</b>

<b>4.Employee-Management System</b>

A basic and functional employee directory and adminstration program, which helps one to view and edit employee details.

<b>Technology used - C++</b>
