Coding is all about growing. I have tried my hands in almost all aspects of the subject and played with some interesting
exercises.

<h1> Selected Projects </h1>

<b>1.Algorithmic Trading Platform </b>					                              
The platform is implemented in Python, and takes the aid of libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib. Stock quotes are received using Quandl and the Simple Moving Average Crossover strategy executes the orders. 
Currently reforming the trading policy to long-short from long-only. Also working on making price predictions using LSTM
Networks.

<b>2. Reinforcement Learning for High Frequency Trading </b>
Taking the aid of Q Learning and Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms, devising a strartegy to asynchronously trade data in the
stock market. 


<b>3.Deep Learning Based Detector</b>

While Python has packages to achieve the job, the end result is what can be characterised as 'unusual'. Deep Learning offers a far nuanced and reliable solution.
I utilised the Caffe framework and came up with the document scanner, which learns and recognises object patterns and most importantly edges, which is the main objective here.

<b>Technology used - Python, Caffe</b>



<b>4.New Hope Organisation Client Onboarding Platform</b>

As a challenge in JP Morgan Chase Code for Good 2020, we (team) came up with a solution to make it easier for social organisations to add in new applicants into their list, through the aid of a mobile application.  
- This not only saves man hours in terms of the time invested in adding a new person, but its also a seamless process because it eliminates the dependency on unorganised forms of communication and administration such as emails and texts.
- With the app, the social worker can simply take in the application, fill it, add the required document and start working.
- We also built an online database management system, functioning as an admin console such that the social organisation overall can have control monitoring over their applicants' status.

<b>Technology used - React, React-Native, Springboot, MaterialUI</b>

<b>5.Employee-Management System</b>

A basic and functional employee directory and adminstration program, which helps one to view and edit employee details.

Some changes

<b>Technology used - C++</b>
