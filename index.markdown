I am currently a Junior, majoring in Computer Engineering, along with a minor in Economics, from the University of Hong Kong (HKU). While there is a lot to share, i'll exercise my brevity and get you up to speed - 

1. I can speak 3 langauges, code in a lot more!

2. I am major basketball fan, if you're a MJ fan, we'll surely get along!

3. Blues and Rock 'N' Roll is the real deal. Prove me wrong.

# My skill set includes - 
1.	Core Languages – C++, C, Python, HTML,Haskell.
2.	Programming Technologies & Frameworks – JavaScript, React, Node.JS, Bash, Git, Express.JS,CSS
3.	Deep Learning – Caffe, Tensorflow (Basic)



Machines have always fascinated me. This led me to my major at University, because a deep knowledge in this subject is a pre-requisite for any scope of further development. My focus lies predominantly in the domain of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. 

<b> I am on the look for roles which align with my interests! </b>

# Academic and Future Aspirations

My academic interests lie in the fields of -
- Deep Learning
- Generative Adverserial Networks
- Acoustic Fingerprinting 
- Artificial Intellegence

As a professional, I first seek to enter and contribute towards the Software Development and Product Development/Design.
